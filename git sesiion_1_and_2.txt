              What is VCS?

VCS stands for version control system.

There are 3 types VCS

1.Local VCS:-
locla vcs are totaly depends upon backend database,it's pull the file
or folder and also push it similarlly,and main thing of local vcs it's
track the data. it's a first concept who is that much capacity to do
this type data fetching.

but the main draw back is if your local sys is damaged your total data was destroy,
and we have no option to recover this data again. and second drawback is you do not
share your data any device.

adv:- Roll back is avialable in loacla vcs.

2.Centralized VCS:-Centralized VCS are totaly depends upon  server, and main thing 
is one to many person are at a time a are used this server for push and pull the files,and 
it's track the file date also person name who is changes tha data as wll as,

if server was damaged all data was deleted,but only few imp data are saved by any user, if he/she knows 
that matter,and in the case of server if many person are worked at a time,it's very slow to push and pull method.

3.Distributed VCS:-Distributed VCS are totaly depends upon cloud,and every data are separated 
by each developer,who is working in own project.if one side of cloud was crashed,so that ni impact other data,
and other data are saved by the could and local system.



Pratical:-

Identity provides to git
there two identity provides to git one is name another is email id.

git config --global user.name "your_name"
git config --global user.email "your@gmail.com"

how check?
git config user.name
git config user.email


 1.$ git init--create a repo on this file

2. $ git status(check the status)

On branch master
No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        biswajit_110cv[1].docx
        firs_class.txt

*** file should be in red color--means--this fils is untracked



3. git add --a   ----stageing are complgte(Unstage to Stage)

means files should be going to stageing area and file also tracked.

 note: if you add single file:- git add .

4.$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   biswajit_110cv[1].docx
        new file:   firs_class.txt

5.$ git commit -m "first_repo"(Version control)

[master (root-commit) 706f107] first_repo
 2 files changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 biswajit_110cv[1].docx
 create mode 100644 firs_class.txt


6.$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean


8.git remote add origin 'paste SSH key'(Repository add)

9.git branch -M main(change master to main and main to master)

10.git push -u origin main (code send local to cloud)

for push the local system to git repositoty
